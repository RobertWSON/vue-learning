## Current Projects

### **1. Olive Oil**

- **Description:**
   A shopping cart application designed for managing olive oil product data. This project focuses on learning and 
   implementing 
   Vue.js, integrating MongoDB for efficient data management and enhancing interactivity through API usage.  

- **Features:**
  - Dynamic front-end built with Vue.js
  - Database Management for storing product details.
  - API endpoints for efficient communication between front-end and back-end.  

- **Technologies:**
  - Front-end - Vue.js, CSS
  - Back-end - Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
  - Build Tools - Vue CLI, Babel, ESLint, Nodemon
  - Utilities - Chalk, Dotenv, Zod
  - APIs - Express endpoints tested with Postman      

- **/front-end folder:**
  - Contains Vue.js application files and CSS.

- **/back-end folder:**
  - Connects to MongoDB Atlas database using a connection string. 
  - APIs for managing and retrieving data. 
  - Features a database connection module and a connection string test to verify MongoDB connectivity.
  - Postman is used to validate API functionality and ensure it meets expected standards.

- **Setup Instructions:**
  - Navigate to `/front-end` folder and run `npm install` to install dependences.
  - Use `npm run serve` to start `front-end` application on a development server.  
  - Refer to README in `/front-end` folder for additional project setup details.
  - Navigate to `/back-end` folder and run `npm install` to install server dependencies.
  - configure `dotenv` for MongoDB connection string.
